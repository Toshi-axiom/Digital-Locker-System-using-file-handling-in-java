# Digital-Locker-System-using-file-handling-in-java
The Digital Locker System is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to securely sign up, log in, and upload personal files to a local locker directory. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, and handles user authentication and file management using file handling in Java.
This project aims to simulate a basic file storage system with login/signup functionalities — similar to how cloud lockers work — but stores data locally for simplicity and academic purposes.

User-friendly GUI made with Java Swing
Secure user sign-up and login system
Credentials stored using basic file handling (users.txt)
File upload functionality to a local folder (locker_files)
